  "Acknowledgements_Description": "I'd like to thank [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) for allowing me to see this project through. I'd also like to thank my wonderful mentors Sam Vassor, KT Duffy, and Ashley Kang for all their (emotional and technical) support and words of wisdom. Finally I'd like to thank Lauren McCarthy, Saber Khan, Qianqian Ye, evelyn masso, Connie Liu, Jiwon Shin and the p5 maintainers and contributors for helping me with this project and being a part of the start of my open source journey 💗",
  "Answer1": "The p5.js Showcase is an online gallery of work created with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), an open source creative computing library. It was created by [Ashley Kang](https://ashleykang.dev) in 2019 ([view the 2019 Showcase here](https://p5js.org/showcase/)), previously curated by [Connie Liu](https://connieliu0.github.io), and currently maintained by [Katie Chan](https://katiechan.cargo.site/). \n \n The purpose of the Showcase is to celebrate how people are using and learning p5.js to make creative work with the aim of conveying our core values of inclusivity.",
  "Answer2": "Usually the p5.js will open up a call for submissions via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/p5xjs) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p5xjs/)!

I used the built-in animation loop of p5 to make the shape move through the years. For the circular shapes, I followed the class-based pattern that I learnt from watching The Coding Train videos. I also learnt about Perlin noise from there (https://youtu.be/Qf4dIN99e2w?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD ), and used it both for the ‘veil’ and for the movement of the circles.

Also, the built-in Perlin noise and the image capabilities.",

There are still some bits that I didn’t manage to iron out, mostly to do with responsiveness. I struggled with figuring out how to ‘escape’ the animation loop, where I wanted the ‘veil’ around the circles to keep expanding over time, while the circles updated with the timeline. I found a solution in creating a background behind just the shapes and updating that on each animation loop, essentially erasing the circles, while keeping the ‘veil’.",

I'm currently making an animation film to go with an (inter)net.art work I made called 'Classic Gold Premium': all part of my Kone foundation funded PhD artistic research project, which situates the growth of the assisted reproductive technology industry in Europe in the context of intensified migratory control systems and the commercial enclosing of the internet.",
      "answer2": "I started using processing for video mapping in 2016 at Hangar.org in Barcelona, then I experimented with processing  for transforming images into sound in 2017 for Criticaldías video project \"Calling the Magician\".

Do they have to write redundant code for features already well accomplished due to lack of information?
