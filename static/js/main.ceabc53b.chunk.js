It has an interactive part that allows for playing with the visual variables to get the best shape before printing to a poster. There is quite a complex data structure that maps a text\'s changelog history into a sort-of tree, but to go into that detail you will have to have a look at my paper, \\"Organic visualization of document evolution\\", which you can look up in Google Scholar (it\'s a short one!).","answer4":"loadJSON is such an important feature when working with data.

The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

My first project was circle moving around with the mouseX and mouseY.","answer3":"I used p5 to render the moveable character around the screen, and also generate the black and white pixels that are used as a depth map for rendering magic eye images (autostereograms). What is notable with this project is that I was able to make moving magic eye images! I had only seen one GIF of a shark that rotated, and wanted to make a game render out of it. I leveraged the awesome library MagicEye.js created by Ian Pearce to turn the black and white p5 sketch into a magic eye image, and im doing that for each frame, at makes the autostereogram move thats something I had never seen before.","answer4":"lerp, mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed, all things createVector!","answer5":"I hit a roadblock with trying to get the pixel data from the p5\'s html5 canvas, so I could feed it into the MagicEye.js library, which turned out not to be so simple. The break though was when I figured out that I could export each frame of the canvas as a image, and feed the raw image into the MagicEye library, it\'s a hack that actually worked! Although it\'s really slow it does the job.","answer6":"Basically anything from this [person](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html).","social":"http://github.com/wisehackermonkey","id":"project-57","picid":"57.png"},{"author":"Deborah Sim","pronouns":"she/her","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","title":"HI!","description":"HI! is an interactive design.

For some specific p5.js-related issues we were having, we reached out to [Kate Hollenbach](http://www.katehollenbach.com/) and [Stalgia Grigg](https://stalgiagrigg.name/) (who worked on the [WebGL implementation in p5.js](https://github.com/Processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+webgl+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl), and they were super helpful. \\n\\n Louise: The learning curve was pretty steep for getting shaders into p5.

As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).

In this class, professor Matt Martin taught me from the very basics of drawing primitive shapes to writing my own functions with generative codes within a semester.","answer3":"The entirety of this project, including the user interface and visual assets, is written in p5.js. The game environment is procedurally generated on top of a custom isometric grid using objects and classes. At the same time, the animation of NPCs relies on the Perlin noise algorithm to power their unique characteristics. In addition to the class materials provided by Matt Martin, I learned a lot about coding through The Nature of Code website and tutorials by Daniel Shiffman. Other references can be found at the top of the main.js file in the project repository.","answer4":"My favorite function is the map() and constrain() because of how we can use them to interpret different values into other meaningful stimuli. I also plan to explore other functions such as loadJSON() to incorporate databases or the p5.serialport library for my next experimentation with ambient computing and interaction design for IoT.","answer5":"I faced many performance issues due to how resource-intensive it is to generate a large playable area and draw all the game objects in the scene. So much of my time went into optimization by ensuring that some visual effects, such as the rain or the water ripples, won\'t get drawn outside the viewing area. In addition, I struggled a lot with how to create real-time shadows for my moving game objects. But I was lucky to come across the CanvasRenderingContext2D from the Canvas API, which allows me to render 2D shadows and maintain a higher framerate. I also didn\'t know how to code graphic shaders, so I had to work with a few basic functions to draw the scene. The key lesson I got from this project is organization. If you ever feel that your task is overwhelming, separate your goal into smaller chunks and work on it one step at a time. This way, the work will be more enjoyable, and you will also have a coherent structure of codes.","answer6":"A project by Yuri Suzuki: https://soundoftheearth.org/","social":"https://www.jasongong.design/","id":"the-healing-forest","picid":"healing-forest.jpeg"},{"author":"Arjun","pronouns":"he/him","location":"Mumbai, India","title":"In Between Life & Death","description":"In Between Life & Death tries to answer why humans are motivated to do what they do.

I had previously made art in rust and wanted to play with something else. I quickly got hooked on how playful p5 was and how playful I could be with it. I hit a rhythm where I was being inspired to make art and the process of creating and interacting with the art led to more inspiration to create more art. \\n\\nHere is the link to my very first p5 sketch in response to the genuary prompt: \'destroy a square\' https://editor.p5js.org/R4chel/full/mFX7ms8Ms. \\n\\nAnd here is what it looked like after 3 hours of playing and exploring what I could in p5: https://editor.p5js.org/R4chel/sketches/1dkGIC84o. \\n\\nMy very first time playing with p5.js was the day before in the context of some pair programming at the recurse center and I was really inspired and decided to play by myself the next day. ","answer3":"This project is fully implemented in p5.js. Here is the source for the formula I used for what I call in my code \'fancy hearts\': https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/heart-polar-coordinates.html. \\n\\nSources for hex codes for pride hearts: https://www.kapwing.com/resources/official-pride-colors-2021-exact-color-codes-for-15-pride-flags/, https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/flags/pride. \\n\\nI used the genuary prompts as a way of growing as an artist and as inspiration for p5 projects. It worked really well together. Here is a collection of pieces I made for genuary, most of which were written in p5.js although some of the pieces were made my existing rust art tool: https://www.symbiocene.gallery/genuary2022-joy-of-randomness","answer4":"I love the editor so much. I love how quickly you can ramp up. I warn people if they spend too much time around me they might accidentally end up writing some p5. I have had the absolute delight of getting so many people to open up the editor and create a circle. Set it\'s color and have it change size / color / position. I love empowering programmers who have never made generative art to make generative art! I\'ve mostly worked with self described non-artist programmers, but also have had the delight of introducing a few kids to programming through the context of let\'s make something on the screen. \\n\\nI love how quickly I can ramp someone up. But also as some one who has been using it for a few months, I love how quickly I can prototype an idea and just have something do something. Related to the editor being my favorite thing I love the auto-refresh checkmark. \\n\\nI am now writing large p5 projects I want version controlled and to deploy myself so I don\'t use the editor nearly as much but that spirit of quick prototyping is still there.","answer5":"The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to rotate the hearts! I defined the hearts in polar coordinates. There is a formula for the points of a heart in terms of radius and theta. If I rotated the shapes by adding a thetaOffset the hearts would overlap because they are not centered at their \'origin.\' \\n\\nThe solution was to relearn some linear algebra! But in simpler terms, to define the circle in terms of a bounding circle and rotate about the center of that bounding circle not the \'origin\' of the heart. I then had to figure out the mapping between center of bounding circle and origin of heart. That I did not do with fancy math. That I did empirically by setting values and drawing both the heart and the bounding circle and just trying different x-offsets and y-offsets until I found values that were close enough. \\n\\nUpdate: Nothing I said above wasn\'t true. Buuuttt after writing that answer yesterday and continuing to work on the project I ended up refactoring and simplifying how a lot of that was done. But the journey was still painful and part of the process, just not quite as reflected in the final code. The change I made was to just translate once at the end rather than translating before rotating and scaling. But understanding how all of it worked and why was key to the moment of realizing I could make it simpler.","answer6":"https://rachel.joyofrandomness.com/art/rust-art/ <--- That is the reason I am an artist.

Then I learnt how to optimally detect collisions among points using quadtree data structure. Although at this time I was not sure how I am supposed to store an entire polygon of multiple points in the quadtree. So, I thought of the following idea - I can store the points of the polygons in the quadtree and those points will have information about to which asteroid/polygon they belong to. This thing also comes with a drawback, that is suppose if a polygon is entirely inside a region of the quadtree, then querying for that region will return some points for the same polygon, meaning I am checking for collision for the same polygon again and again which is not efficient at all. So, what I have done is I have created a set in which I am storing the polygons to which those nearby points I got by querying the quadtree belongs. Therefore in that set I have unique values/asteroids only without any duplicates. This is the main basic idea. I am not sure if I should store polygons inside a quadtree like this or not but this is the only idea came to my mind.","answer4":"One of the favourite features of mine is be able to work with vectors both in two and three dimensions in the html canvas with p5.

I was using bootstrap modals to provide some information about my project and I wanted to activate the modal by clicking on a button on canvas i.e. a p5 touch gui library button and that modal closes normally by clicking on a normal DOM button. This thing works 100% fine with a mouse. But when it comes to touch screen devices, any DOM button is unclickable the moment p5 touch gui library is initialised. I have cross checked this fact that if I invoke createGui() method of the p5 touch gui, any other DOM button is unclickable in touch screen. I don\'t kno why this is happening and I think to fix it I might have to use some other buttons library but for now, reloading the game works as a brute force way.","social":"Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/biswayan.nandi.7, GitHub - https://github.com/Biswayan375","id":"asteroids-with-quadtree","picid":"asteroids.jpeg"}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"viz2.1":"self-learners","viz2.2":"and animators, artists, game makers, creative-technologists, curriculum planners, designers, graphic designers, graphics editors, learning experience designers, project managers, software engineer, student, teachers, university faculty members, visualization researchers","viz2.3":"w/ all kinds of experiences","Directionsmap":"Click on the stars to learn more!","Directions":"Click on the pink text to change graphs!","Directions2":"Press space to interact with this visualization!","Created By":"Created By","2020Gallery_Intro":"To learn more about the project and how it was made, click on the image of each card preview. \\n\\nFeel free to leave feedback or a comment in our [guestbook](https://forms.gle/Mxb2thi2k27EZ3Mo7)!","Project Links":"Project Links","Visualizations":"Visualizations","Projects":"Projects","Social Media":"Social Media","Tools":"Tools","Live":"Live","Code":"Code","About1":"What is the p5.js Showcase?","About2":"How is it organized?","About3":"What else should I check out?","Acknowledgements":"Acknowledgements","Acknowledgements_Description":"I\'d like to thank [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) for allowing me to see this project through.

I am a 2020 [Processing Foundation Fellow](https://Processingfoundation.org/fellowships) and my project was my Twitch channel, [Cozy Coding](https://twitch.tv/cozycoding).","answer2":"I first learned p5.js in my sophomore year of college as a computer science and fine art student in Golan Levin\'s class (thanks Golan <3).  Based on my p5.js web editor and OpenProcessing sketch history, my very first project was a sketch that generated lines and had a circle at all intersections made by those lines. When the mouse was clicked, new lines would appear on the screen and new intersections would be highlighted. The project was aptly called \\"Intersections\\".","answer3":"I brainstormed this project for my Processing Fellowship application. The hook to it was \\"If Dan Shiffman\'s Coding Train is a college lecture, then Cozy Coding is that chill RA that your older sibling is friends with, who took the class already, and will gladly answer your questions and show you cool stuff.\\" I borrowed some media hardware from the Studio for Creative Inquiry, made a Twitch account, drafted some very loose lesson plans, and dove into streaming. Every stream I would launch the p5.js web editor, look at the reference to see if something caught my eye, and demoed it live to my viewers. I\'ve covered the basics like shapes and animation and more advanced topics like the WEBGL renderer. Currently, we\'re on the topic of shaders! I\'m learning simultaneously with my viewers so it is quite the ride.","answer4":"blendMode is my favorite function, hands down. A lot of weird interactions start to occur when you experiment with the different types of blending. I believe mastering blendMode is one of the keys to unlocking the full power of p5.js and I cannot wait to obtain it.","answer5":"I was very nervous about the act of streaming that I put off starting my project for a month and a half. Of course, COVID did not help with the anxiety at all, but I was afraid to make mistakes or be wrong on stream (and in real life, to be honest). I find that the mainstream tech and academic community aren\'t too kind to people, especially BIPOC, who make a mistake or are incorrect about something so there\'s an expectation to know everything. My family put an unhealthy amount of pressure on me to be the very best and I come from a high achieving high school and college, so I correlated failing with deep shame. Streaming is different than uploading a prerecorded video as there\'s no way to edit out your mistakes so I felt the pressure to be completely perfect and kept together.\\n\\nWhen I first started streaming I was so tense and I felt like I was walking on eggshells because I just didn\'t want to screw up, not even by a little. It wasn\'t fun. I reflected on why I wanted to create this stream - a beginner friendly and relaxed place to code creatively. Not making mistakes was simply unrealistic and went against the intended theming and mood of my streams, so I accepted making mistakes, being wrong, and having three tabs of the p5.js reference open on my browser. I also made it clear to my viewers that it\'s not the quality of the code that matters, it\'s the output that the code creates because gorgeous code and ugly code have the same value if what they output is the same.

I am interested in incorporating storytelling elements into creative projects that can transform traditionally analog spaces (such as museums, classrooms...)","answer2":"To start with, my previous experience with Processing back when I was taking Intro to Interactive Media paved the way I used p5.js in my projects. As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4). Being in New York for the first time at the time, I was surrounded by the vibrant dating scene the city had to offer. Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.","answer5":"Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone. I had to pay close attention to setting the right z-index, position (absolute), elements\' widths and heights to ensure a seamless integration of p5.js with other DOMs into a one-page web game.","answer6":"I mostly use p5.js for 2D projects; however, when it comes to 3D and WebXR, I find A-Frame.js framework extremely easy to learn and versatile to use. A-Frame.js really reminds me of p5.js as both are accessible to creative artists who do not necessarily have technical background on computer graphics.","social":"https://nguyenvince.github.io/","id":"project-8","picid":"8.png"},{"author":"Summer Rizzo","pronouns":"she/her","location":"New York City, United States","title":"The Fractal Zone","description":"An interactive fractal tree machine based on L-Systems.","extradesc":"The Fractal Zone is a pair project I made with Sean Brown that houses a \\"Fractal Machine\\", which draws fractal trees to a canvas based on user parameters.

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track.

The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

Except for the preProcessing of the data, which was done in Python, it loads the data, draws it and controls the side menu with the dom library.\\n\\nAlthough many think of D3 as the best tool for visualization, p5 lends itself so much more to creativity. I always work my visualizations from scratch with p5, as anyone that looks into my code will confirm. Also that I am not a very good programmer.

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

Its incredible, the extent to which any and all possibilities have been met :D","answer5":"Yes, I had quite a bit of trouble in mapping the frequency array values to points on a circle. I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle. Worked out great!","answer6":"I found this website called Coolors, which generates color palettes for you.

Every stream I would launch the p5.js web editor, look at the reference to see if something caught my eye, and demoed it live to my viewers.

Of course, COVID did not help with the anxiety at all, but I was afraid to make mistakes or be wrong on stream (and in real life, to be honest). I find that the mainstream tech and academic community aren\'t too kind to people, especially BIPOC, who make a mistake or are incorrect about something so there\'s an expectation to know everything. My family put an unhealthy amount of pressure on me to be the very best and I come from a high achieving high school and college, so I correlated failing with deep shame. Streaming is different than uploading a prerecorded video as there\'s no way to edit out your mistakes so I felt the pressure to be completely perfect and kept together.\\n\\nWhen I first started streaming I was so tense and I felt like I was walking on eggshells because I just didn\'t want to screw up, not even by a little. It wasn\'t fun. I reflected on why I wanted to create this stream - a beginner friendly and relaxed place to code creatively. Not making mistakes was simply unrealistic and went against the intended theming and mood of my streams, so I accepted making mistakes, being wrong, and having three tabs of the p5.js reference open on my browser. I also made it clear to my viewers that it\'s not the quality of the code that matters, it\'s the output that the code creates because gorgeous code and ugly code have the same value if what they output is the same.

I am interested in incorporating storytelling elements into creative projects that can transform traditionally analog spaces (such as museums, classrooms...)","answer2":"To start with, my previous experience with Processing back when I was taking Intro to Interactive Media paved the way I used p5.js in my projects. As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4). Being in New York for the first time at the time, I was surrounded by the vibrant dating scene the city had to offer. Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.","answer5":"Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone.

The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

I had to consider this problem, and I finally decided to draw only the last calculated \\"line parts\\" and keep the rest as it was on the previous update (each time draw is called, I draw just a little more).

I am interested in incorporating storytelling elements into creative projects that can transform traditionally analog spaces (such as museums, classrooms...)","answer2":"To start with, my previous experience with Processing back when I was taking Intro to Interactive Media paved the way I used p5.js in my projects. As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4). Being in New York for the first time at the time, I was surrounded by the vibrant dating scene the city had to offer. Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.","answer5":"Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone. I had to pay close attention to setting the right z-index, position (absolute), elements\' widths and heights to ensure a seamless integration of p5.js with other DOMs into a one-page web game.","answer6":"I mostly use p5.js for 2D projects; however, when it comes to 3D and WebXR, I find A-Frame.js framework extremely easy to learn and versatile to use. A-Frame.js really reminds me of p5.js as both are accessible to creative artists who do not necessarily have technical background on computer graphics.","social":"https://nguyenvince.github.io/","id":"project-8","picid":"8.png"},{"author":"Summer Rizzo","pronouns":"she/her","location":"New York City, United States","title":"The Fractal Zone","description":"An interactive fractal tree machine based on L-Systems.","extradesc":"The Fractal Zone is a pair project I made with Sean Brown that houses a \\"Fractal Machine\\", which draws fractal trees to a canvas based on user parameters.

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.
