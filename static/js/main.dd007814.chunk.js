I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

My first project was circle moving around with the mouseX and mouseY.","answer3":"I used p5 to render the moveable character around the screen, and also generate the black and white pixels that are used as a depth map for rendering magic eye images (autostereograms). What is notable with this project is that I was able to make moving magic eye images! I had only seen one GIF of a shark that rotated, and wanted to make a game render out of it. I leveraged the awesome library MagicEye.js created by Ian Pearce to turn the black and white p5 sketch into a magic eye image, and im doing that for each frame, at makes the autostereogram move thats something I had never seen before.","answer4":"lerp, mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed, all things createVector!","answer5":"I hit a roadblock with trying to get the pixel data from the p5\'s html5 canvas, so I could feed it into the MagicEye.js library, which turned out not to be so simple. The break though was when I figured out that I could export each frame of the canvas as a image, and feed the raw image into the MagicEye library, it\'s a hack that actually worked! Although it\'s really slow it does the job.","answer6":"Basically anything from this [person](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html).","social":"http://github.com/wisehackermonkey","id":"project-57","picid":"57.png"},{"author":"Deborah Sim","pronouns":"she/her","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","title":"HI!","description":"HI! is an interactive design.

For some specific p5.js-related issues we were having, we reached out to [Kate Hollenbach](http://www.katehollenbach.com/) and [Stalgia Grigg](https://stalgiagrigg.name/) (who worked on the [WebGL implementation in p5.js](https://github.com/Processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+webgl+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl), and they were super helpful. \\n\\n Louise: The learning curve was pretty steep for getting shaders into p5.

As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).

This summer, I was a part of Google Summer of Code to create a community-focused visual narrative website with audio visualizations created in p5.","answer2":"I first learned p5.js early this year. It was in my Programming for Artists class with professor Stalgia Grigg. My first project was to create a still-life by only using p5.js. I later used map(), mouseX, and mouseY to make the still-life interactive with a parallax effect.","answer3":"I used p5.js in this project to make the visual elements interactable. The illustrated elements within the portrait were first drawn by hand, photographed, edited in Adobe Photoshop, and later uploaded into the p5 editor. The illustration was separated into layers which allowed me to create a parallax effect using map(), mouseX, and mouseY. I also used millis() and if statements to compose an animated gif within the editor. \\n\\nOnce I finished the basic portrait, I added HTML and CSS elements to show descriptions. I used p5.Element, select(), and other Event listeners to have the HTML elements change based on interactions with the p5.js portrait. \\n\\nAfter creating the sketch within the p5 editor, I transported the files to a local development environment for better compatibility across various browsers.","answer4":"My favorite function is mouseX and mouseY. I love seeing live interaction with digitally created elements. As an artist and designer, many of my creations were either still or animated but never interactive. The possibilities from these simple codes are endless and exciting.","answer5":"I faced many challenges during this project. The only reason I was able to finish it in 3 weeks is because of my professor who knew all the answers to my questions. I was originally planning to create four different portraits which later changed to two, and ultimately one.

I enjoy working with fine art, graphic design, and multi-media art. This summer, I was a part of Google Summer of Code to create a community-focused visual narrative website with audio visualizations created in p5.","answer2":"I first learned p5.js early this year. It was in my Programming for Artists class with professor Stalgia Grigg. My first project was to create a still-life by only using p5.js. I later used map(), mouseX, and mouseY to make the still-life interactive with a parallax effect.","answer3":"I used p5.js in this project to make the visual elements interactable. The illustrated elements within the portrait were first drawn by hand, photographed, edited in Adobe Photoshop, and later uploaded into the p5 editor. The illustration was separated into layers which allowed me to create a parallax effect using map(), mouseX, and mouseY. I also used millis() and if statements to compose an animated gif within the editor. \\n\\nOnce I finished the basic portrait, I added HTML and CSS elements to show descriptions. I used p5.Element, select(), and other Event listeners to have the HTML elements change based on interactions with the p5.js portrait. \\n\\nAfter creating the sketch within the p5 editor, I transported the files to a local development environment for better compatibility across various browsers.","answer4":"My favorite function is mouseX and mouseY. I love seeing live interaction with digitally created elements. As an artist and designer, many of my creations were either still or animated but never interactive. The possibilities from these simple codes are endless and exciting.","answer5":"I faced many challenges during this project. The only reason I was able to finish it in 3 weeks is because of my professor who knew all the answers to my questions. I was originally planning to create four different portraits which later changed to two, and ultimately one. The coding portion took the most time since I never get anything right with code on my first try. It took many attempts before having the code work smoothly. I have learned that with coding, it takes a lot of patients and optimism that if you continue to work on it, you will get it right.","answer6":"I personally love stop motion and I get many inspirations form wanting to combine 2d elements with 3d textures and effects.

I used the built-in animation loop of p5 to make the shape move through the years. For the circular shapes, I followed the class-based pattern that I learnt from watching The Coding Train videos. I also learnt about Perlin noise from there (https://youtu.be/Qf4dIN99e2w?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD ), and used it both for the \u2018veil\u2019 and for the movement of the circles.

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.","answer5":"Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone. I had to pay close attention to setting the right z-index, position (absolute), elements\' widths and heights to ensure a seamless integration of p5.js with other DOMs into a one-page web game.","answer6":"I mostly use p5.js for 2D projects; however, when it comes to 3D and WebXR, I find A-Frame.js framework extremely easy to learn and versatile to use. A-Frame.js really reminds me of p5.js as both are accessible to creative artists who do not necessarily have technical background on computer graphics.","social":"https://nguyenvince.github.io/","id":"project-8","picid":"8.png"},{"author":"Summer Rizzo","pronouns":"she/her","location":"New York City, United States","title":"The Fractal Zone","description":"An interactive fractal tree machine based on L-Systems.","extradesc":"The Fractal Zone is a pair project I made with Sean Brown that houses a \\"Fractal Machine\\", which draws fractal trees to a canvas based on user parameters.

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

Its incredible, the extent to which any and all possibilities have been met :D","answer5":"Yes, I had quite a bit of trouble in mapping the frequency array values to points on a circle. I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle. Worked out great!","answer6":"I found this website called Coolors, which generates color palettes for you. You can choose the number of colors you want, can lock in one color and generate new ones for the rest, and can very conveniently copy the color code in any format- hex, rgb, hsb!

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle. Worked out great!","answer6":"I found this website called Coolors, which generates color palettes for you. You can choose the number of colors you want, can lock in one color and generate new ones for the rest, and can very conveniently copy the color code in any format- hex, rgb, hsb!

What is notable with this project is that I was able to make moving magic eye images! I had only seen one GIF of a shark that rotated, and wanted to make a game render out of it.

I set a condition so whenever the word \\"pew\\" or a mouse click was detected, the scrolling speed would change to make an illusion of Airi flying up.

I am interested in incorporating storytelling elements into creative projects that can transform traditionally analog spaces (such as museums, classrooms...)","answer2":"To start with, my previous experience with Processing back when I was taking Intro to Interactive Media paved the way I used p5.js in my projects. As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4). Being in New York for the first time at the time, I was surrounded by the vibrant dating scene the city had to offer. Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.","answer5":"Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone. I had to pay close attention to setting the right z-index, position (absolute), elements\' widths and heights to ensure a seamless integration of p5.js with other DOMs into a one-page web game.","answer6":"I mostly use p5.js for 2D projects; however, when it comes to 3D and WebXR, I find A-Frame.js framework extremely easy to learn and versatile to use. A-Frame.js really reminds me of p5.js as both are accessible to creative artists who do not necessarily have technical background on computer graphics.","social":"https://nguyenvince.github.io/","id":"project-8","picid":"8.png"},{"author":"Summer Rizzo","pronouns":"she/her","location":"New York City, United States","title":"The Fractal Zone","description":"An interactive fractal tree machine based on L-Systems.","extradesc":"The Fractal Zone is a pair project I made with Sean Brown that houses a \\"Fractal Machine\\", which draws fractal trees to a canvas based on user parameters.

I watched Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \\nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn\'t clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn\'t get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

For some specific p5.js-related issues we were having, we reached out to [Kate Hollenbach](http://www.katehollenbach.com/) and [Stalgia Grigg](https://stalgiagrigg.name/) (who worked on the [WebGL implementation in p5.js](https://github.com/Processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+webgl+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl), and they were super helpful. \\n\\n Louise: The learning curve was pretty steep for getting shaders into p5.

As both have an extremely similar framework, the transition from Processing to p5.js was quick and enjoyable. After Professor Craig Protzel walked me through the basic of p5.js, I realized that I could develop creative coding projects and share them to everyone on the web. Love Maze is probably my first serious p5.js project!","answer3":"I was inspired by (the one and only) Daniel Shiffman\'s tutorial on [how to create a maze in p5.js] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other\'s compatibility while performing teamwork.\\n\\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \\"roadblock\\". By using p5.js\' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\\n\\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \\"roadblocks\\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze\'s dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.","answer4":"My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).
